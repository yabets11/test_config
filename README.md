# A Little About Me
I'm a Mathematics Major and Computer Science Minor at San Jose State Universiry. I am also a producer, and soon to be recording artist. I love love going on runs, working out, making music, watching good shows and bad movies, exploring new place and just enjoying myself as much as I can. I grew up in South Hayward my whole life, and consier myself to be an east bay baby.
